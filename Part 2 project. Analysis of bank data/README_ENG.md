## Borrower Reliability Research - bank data analysis.

**Project status:** *completed*

**Libraries used:** `pandas`

### Description of the project:

The customer is the credit department of the Bank.

Input data from the Bank - statistics on the solvency of Clients (file: `data.csv`).

**Purpose of the study**

Check whether the fact of repaying the loan on time affects:
 1. Marital status of the Client.
 2. Number of children of the Client.
 3. Client's income level.
 4. Different loan purposes.


**Research Progress**

The study will take place in three stages:
 1. Data review.
 2. Data preprocessing.
 3. Hypothesis testing.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the ability to
potential borrower to repay the loan to the Bank.

**Conclusion on the project:**

- it is harder for people who are officially married to repay a loan on time;
- children have a positive effect on parents and they make loan payments in due time;
- the "richest" and the "poorest" are also the most conscientious credit payers;
- its return on time depends on the purpose of the loan, so loans taken on real estate return worse.
