# Examining data hosted on the StackOverflow platform

**Project status:** completed

**Libraries used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `sys`, `sqlalchemy`, `datetime`, `seaborn`, `warnings`

### Description of the project:

We will work with the StackOverflow database - a service for questions and answers about programming. StackOverflow is like a social network - users of the service ask questions, reply to posts, leave comments, and rate other answers. The work will be carried out with the version of the database where data on posts for 2008 is stored, but the tables will also contain information about later ratings that these posts received.

**Our task** is to perform various data uploads using SQL queries and analyze the results.


**Research** will take place in three stages:
 1. Studying the scheme (ER-diagrams).
 2. Data review.
 3. Unloading data using SQL queries and analysis.
