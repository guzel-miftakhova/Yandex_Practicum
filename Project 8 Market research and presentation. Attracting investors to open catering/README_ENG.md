**Project status:** *completed*

**Libraries used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `sys`, `io`, `requests`, `datetime`, `seaborn`

### Description of the project:

We decided to open a small cafe in Moscow. It is original - guests should be served by robots. The project is promising, but expensive.

Together with partners, we decided to turn to investors. They are interested in the current state of affairs in the market - whether we can gain popularity for a long time,
when all the onlookers have seen enough of the robot waiters?

**Our task** is to prepare a market research.
We have open data on catering establishments in Moscow.


**Research** will take place in three stages:
 1. Data review and data preprocessing.
 2. Preliminary analysis.
 3. Preparing a presentation.
 
 **Conclusions on the project:**
 
 It is worth noting that there are not so many cafeterias and eateries in Moscow, a small establishment accommodates, on average, about 17 seats, the streets most sparsely populated by establishments are Kutuzovsky Prospekt and Vernadsky Prospekt in the Western Administrative District, as well as Sosenskoye - a settlement in the Novomoskovsky District of the capital . There is also the possibility of developing into a network, because. network establishments are much smaller in Moscow.
