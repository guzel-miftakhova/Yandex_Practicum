**Project status:** *completed*

**Libraries used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `datetime`, `seaborn`, `IPython.display`

### Description of the project:

We are conducting a market analysis of the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment app.

For the past few months, the business has consistently suffered losses - a lot of money has been invested in attracting users, but to no avail.
We have to study how people use the product, when they start to buy, how much money each client brings, when it pays off
and what factors negatively affect user acquisition.

**We need to** understand the reasons for this situation.

**Research** will take place in four stages:
 1. Data review, data preprocessing.
 2. Preparation of functions for the calculation and analysis of business indicators.
 3. Preliminary analysis.
 4. Marketing and ROI.
 
**Conclusions on the project:**
- for users from the USA, there is a problem of high spending on advertising through the TipTop channel, which is not compensated even by the high quality and conversion of users of this channel;
- also pay attention to the Wahoonetbanner and Lambdamediaads channels, Germany and the UK, Android users, they have not bad retention, conversion and LTV, as well as relatively low acquisition costs, possibly due to additional advertising campaigns with personal promotions for current and new users, it will be possible to optimize the current cost picture.
