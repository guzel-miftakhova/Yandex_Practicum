## Study of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg - analysis of the real estate market

**Project status:** *completed*

**Libraries used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`

### Description of the project:

We have at our disposal the data of the Yandex.Real Estate service - an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years.

Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically on the basis of cartographic data.
For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.

**Our mission**
    
  Set parameters for determining the market value of real estate objects. This will allow you to build an automated system:
  it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

**Research Progress**

The study will take place in three stages:
 1. Data review.
 2. Data preprocessing.
 3. Setting parameters.
 
 **Conclusions on the project:**
 
 The value of the property, both in St. Petersburg and in neighboring settlements, is significantly affected by:
 - its area, the number of rooms, there is an inverse relationship with the distance from the center;
 - in the central district of St. Petersburg, the last floors are more preferred than the first, however, regardless of the area, most of the presented apartments are located on the intermediate floors;
 - and their cost is about 2 times lower than that of apartments on the first and last floors.
