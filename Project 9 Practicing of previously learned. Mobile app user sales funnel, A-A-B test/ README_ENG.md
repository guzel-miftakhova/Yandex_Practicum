## Study app user behavior and test font changes

**Project status:** *completed*

**Libraries used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `sys`, `io`, `requests`, `datetime`, `plotly`, `scipy`, `math`

### Description of the project:

We have a startup that sells food.

**Need to figure it out**:
1. How mobile app users behave.

Find out how users reach a purchase. How many users reach the purchase, and how many get stuck on the previous steps? Which ones exactly?

2. After that, explore the results of the A/A/B experiment.

Designers wanted to change fonts throughout the application, but managers were hesitant because users may be uncomfortable. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new ones. Let's find out which font is better.

In the case of general analytics and an A/A/B experiment, we will work with the same data.

**Research** will take place in three stages:
 1. Data review and data preprocessing.
 2. Research of user behavior.
 3. A/A/B experiment.
 
 **Conclusions on the project:**
 
It can be assumed that in general, changing fonts does not have a strong impact on user behavior in the application.
