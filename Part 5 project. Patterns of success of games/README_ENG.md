## Studying the patterns that determine the success of games

**Project status:** *completed*

**Libraries used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `sys`, `seaborn`

### Description of the project:

Historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStaticon) are available from open sources. We have data up to 2016. It's the end of the year and we're planning a campaign for next year.

**Our mission**
identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

**Research Progress**

The study will take place in four stages:
 1. Overview of data
 2. Data preprocessing
 3. Preliminary analysis
 4. Checking hypotheses:
     * average user ratings for `Xbox One` and `PC` platforms are the same;
     * average user ratings for `Action` and `Sports` genres are different.

**Conclusions on the project:**
- the market of North America, Europe and others is different from Japan;
- popular genres are action, sports, shooter, misc, racing, role-playing;
- best selling games for everyone, for people from 17 years old and for teenagers 13-19 years old;
- more games were bought for the Xbox (One), PS (PS4, PSV), Nintendo (3DS) and PC platforms.
